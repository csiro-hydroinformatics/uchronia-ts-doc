# Uchronia - time series handling for ensembles simulations and forecasts

> Python classes for N-dim time series handling

## Overview

**Placeholder**

Uchronia is a C++ library designed to handle multidimensional time series and ensemble thereof. [Uchronia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uchronia) is a literary neologism for a hypothetical or fictional time-period of our world. This seems a suitable name for a library primarily designed notably to handle retrospective ensemble forecast time series.

Some key capabilities are:

* Off the shelf support for point time series and time series of ensemble forecast
* Extensibility to various data types (numeric or not) through C++ templates, e.g. to a "time series of spatial grids"
* High level language bindings for R, Python, Matlab, and others via a consistent "C" API.
